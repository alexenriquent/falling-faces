## Falling Faces ##

The basic aim of the game is for the player to use buttons to control the teensy and move a small sprite around the screen until the player achieves 20 points. The sprite may be a simple character, such as the letter ‘H’, or something more imaginative. Faces appear at the top of the screen and move vertically downwards, however they can appear initially at random horizontal positions. The user has no control over where the faces appear initially. The player starts with 3 lives. There are three (3) possible faces: Smiley, Mad, and Angry. When the player’s avatar hits Smiley two (2) points are gained; when the player hits Mad the falling speed of face motion is increased; and finally when the player hits Angry, one (1) life is lost. The game ends when the player has no remaining lives, or when a score of 20 is achieved. A higher level of difficulty is possible where movement of the hero are controlled by an external command or character sent from a laptop or PC.
